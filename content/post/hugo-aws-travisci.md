How I set up a static https website using S3 buckets, Cloudfront, Route S3, Hugo and Travis CI.
<!--more-->

When I decided to move this site away from Github pages one of the first things people suggested to me was AWS. It's cheap, reliable and easy! Not only did I move from GH to an S3 bucket, I also abandoned [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in favour of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

This post describes the actions taken and lessons learned.

## Hugo
Hugo!

## AWS
AWS!

## Travis CI
Travis!
