I took apart and cleaned the bike's drivetrain and bottom bracket until I figured out my shoes were to blame.

## Noisy road bike.. or shoes?
Lately my road bike has been making a lot of strange noises which I just couldn't seem to fix. It'd be fine during my morning commutes but then start squeaking on the ride home. Other days it would be quiet the first 75k of a 100k ride and then start acting up. I took apart the bike and cleaned everything, including the bottom bracket and the usual suspects... my [Look Keo 2 Max](https://www.lookcycle.com/en/pedale/new-keo-2-max/) pedals. I couldn't figure out what was causing the noise until I heard it again walking around in the garden. Turns out some Sidi shoes are prone to squeaking when slightly dirty.

## Fix: teflon spray
Fixing the problem is easy enough - just apply some teflon spray or wd40 to the part of the shoes' tongue that rubs the velcro straps and the noise will go away. I'm not the only one to find this solution, [bikeforums](http://www.bikeforums.net/road-cycling/946190-sidi-shoe-squeak.html), [roadbikereview](http://forums.roadbikereview.com/general-cycling-discussion/squeaking-sidi-genius-4-shoes-22899.html) and forums [advrider](http://advrider.com/index.php?threads/fixing-the-sidi-adventure-squeak.636675/) all had users post this problem and solution.
